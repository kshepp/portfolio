<h3>Broke @ TechTown Detroit</h3>

<p>
For my internship in the summer of 2015, I participated in TechTown Detroit's DTX Launch program, 
  which is a 10 week student accelerator program on customer discovery. During my time in TechTown and TechArb, 
  where The Broke App incubates, I completed the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Awarded the 'Get Set' award from TechTown and Bank of America for diligence in the customer discovery process</li>
<li>Created a viable business canvas model</li>
<li>Completed over 100 interviews with students, banks, financial literacy experts, investment firms, and 
other entrepreneurs in the FinTech space</li>
<li>Pitched weekly to members of the New Enterprise Forum of Michigan to receive feedback and refine 
business canvas model</li>
<li>Created and tested lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes (Sketch) to verify value provided as given in customer feedback</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<br />

Our affinity wall of customer data. It's about 1/4 of the way complete in the picture:

<h3>Broke @ UMSI</h3>
<p>
  The Broke App began when our team met at the <a href="newyorktrek.php">New York Innovation Trek</a> and formed 
  around a passion for financial literacy. Since New York we've been a lot of places pitching, iterating, and adapting 
  the idea to feedback received. This video created by the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of 
  Michigan School of Information</a> shows our journey up through the Summer of 2015.
